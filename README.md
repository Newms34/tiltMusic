##Explanation
 - tiltMusic is a musical proof-of-concept. We tie the data from multiple phone accelerometers to a the browser's web audio
api.
 - This was written for the February 28th Monthly Music Hackathon at Spotify, in NYC, NY.

##Installation
>Installation is pretty easy. 
 1. Clone the repo.
 2. Run ```npm install```

##Use
>You'll need:
 1. A phone. Or multiple phones.
 2. A computer to act as the server.
 3. A wireless network.
>To use:
 1. Run ```npm start```.
 2. Take a note of the ip address reported in the console. 
 3. In your browser, go to that ip address :3000. So if it's 192.168.1.42, go to 192.168.1.42:3000.
 4. Open the same site on your phone browser(s)
