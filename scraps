MISCELLANEOUS SCRAPS:



socket.on('disconnect',function(){
        var ipInc = socket.handshake.address;
        console.log('User ',ipInc,' disconnected.')
        for (var i=0; i< allOscs.length;i++){
            //loop thru all users. Change target user, then build
            //freq list for all users.
            if (allOscs[i].ip==ipInc){
                //found the user, so remove their data!
                allOscs.splice(i,1);
                allUserNames.splice(i,1);
            }
        }
    });


is there a way to forcibly remove a user from the list of socket 'clients'? I.e., to not listen to any events incoming from that user?
one way may be to generate a 'banned list'. 
1)if user hasn't been active in 4000 ms, send to banned list and remove allOscs object 
2)if user then rejoins (reloads site), remove from ban list (if present), and re-initiate user.
